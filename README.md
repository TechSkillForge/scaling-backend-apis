# Scaling Backend APIs with Limited Resources

See: [scaling-backend-apis-limited-resources](https://tech-skill-forge.vercel.app/challenges/scaling-backend-apis-limited-resources)

## Problem

Developers often face the challenge of optimizing backend services when resources are limited, especially in high-traffic environments. By leveraging techniques such as connection pooling, load balancing, and performance tuning, a system can serve more users with fewer resources and developers can ensure that backend APIs remain responsive and available, even under heavy loads. This challenge explores how to implement these concepts to enhance performance and scalability in a constrained environment.

## Starting Point

The following language-specific starting points are available:
